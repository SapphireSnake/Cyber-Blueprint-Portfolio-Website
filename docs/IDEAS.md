## Features to Revisit

### Konami Code / God Mode
-   **Concept**: An "Easter Egg" triggered by the Konami Code (`↑↑↓↓←→←→BA`) or a hidden button.
-   **Effect**: Unlocks a "God Mode" with visual effects (rainbow border, red tint) and potentially overclocks the system animations.
-   **Status**: Implemented but removed for simplicity. Code logic involved a global event listener and a `KonamiCode` component.
