# Firefox Theme Inspired Portfolio Website

A high-performance, immersive portfolio website built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

Designed with a **"Schematic" aesthetic** inspired by the Firefox brand identity, featuring:
-   **Void & Fire Themes**: A dynamic color system that switches between a deep "Void" (Blue/Purple) and a vibrant "Fire" (Yellow/Red) aesthetic.
-   **Smooth Color Shifting**: Advanced CSS `@property` animations for fluid theme transitions.
-   **Modern UI**: Glassmorphism, layered shadows, and interactive grid backgrounds.
